## NAME

Brandon Craig

## DESCRIPTION

This site is my portfolio. I've provided links to <a href="http://localhost:52330/bcraig-portolio/index.html" target="_blank">projects</a> I've worked on, my 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-craig-4735b7203/" target="_blank">linkedin</a> profile, and my <a href="https://github.com/bcraig-13" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page.


## USAGE

    *index.html - The "About Me" page is the index of my portfolio. The image must be contained in the same column as the first <p> tag so
    that the text will wrap around it on smaller displays.  

    *portfolio.html - This page will display the projects I've worked on. I have bootstrap classes set in the images to make them responsive
    for smaller displays.

    *contact.html - This page will send a message to me with the user's name, email, and comments. The submit button will not actually submit any
    data, but I've included a small bit of javascript to display an alert letting the user know their message has been delivered and clears the form.

    *Navbar - The navbar is displayed on all three pages. The page the user is currently on will be listed as active (brighter text). Clicking on my name 
    in the top-left will return the user to the index.html. While viewed on smaller displays the navbar will lose the links and gain a toggle button that
    can be expanded to display the links.

## SUPPORT

*Issues regarding the css or javascript can be found through getbootstrap.com. For questions regarding the html, use the contact page.
